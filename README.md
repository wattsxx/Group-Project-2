Describing your dataset and what data it contains:
IMDb is the largest database of movies and television shows. This dataset consists of the top 250 movies IMDb rates since 1921 through 2022. This list contains pertinent information to these 250 movies including, rank, year, rating, budget and box office. This list was last updated in 2022 and doesn’t contain any movies in 2023. The columns are rank, which lists the rank the movie is out of 250, rated by IMDb. Name, which lists the movie name. Year, which displays the year the movie was released. Rating shows the movie critics’ rating of the movie out of 10. Genre shows the genre of the movie out of broad categories such as horror, action, or thriller. Certificate displays whether the movie was G, PG, PG-13, or R. Run_time shows the timestamp of the length of the movie. Tagline displays a famous line from each movie. Budget shows the amount of money they spent to make the movie. Box_office shows the amount of money the movie made from theaters. Casts lists all the actors that performed in the movie. Directors, lists the director(s) who directed the movie. Writers lists the writers who made the movie. We found this data set through Kaggle.

## Description

This final graph is to confirm our findings found in our recency bias graph. We found that there was a slight trend upwards for the newer years. In this graph we took the sum of the ratings, and displayed it across years. This works to show that the newer years have a higher overall sum of ratings. Had this been a dataset of a random set of movies this would not work, however this dataset already shows the top 250 movies, meaning that by providing the sum of ratings shows that years may have had multiple movies all within the top 250. We had a definite peak around the 90s, which was anticipated. We hypothesized that this could be a trend once we found that IMDB was started in the 90s, and this graph confirms our hypothesis.
